Challenge

You are given an array of strings representing a list of items to purchase at a grocery store. You are also given a list of items that are currently in the user's cart. Write a function that returns an array of strings representing the items that the user still needs to purchase.

For example, given the grocery list ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'pear'] and the cart list ['banana', 'pear'], the function should return ['apple', 'orange'], since these are the items that are still missing from the user's cart.
Requirements

    Implement the function in JavaScript using ReactJS.

    The function should take two arrays of strings as input: the grocery list and the cart list.

    The function should return an array of strings representing the items that the user still needs to purchase.



    Write a test suite to verify that your function works correctly.

Submission

Please submit your code as a GitHub repository with a README file explaining how to run your tests.

Good luck!
